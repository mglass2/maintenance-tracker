when creating maintenacne template during the create-item-type process, the application prompts the user to select from a list of existing task types from other item types.  If creating a new item type, we only want the option of creating new task types


when successfully creating a new maintenance template record through the create-maintenance-template cli command, the command only lets you create one record and then sends you back to the main prompt.  it should ask the user if they want to create another maintenance template record (yes/no).
