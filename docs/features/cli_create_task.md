after selecting the item in the create-task cli command, the user is not presented with the list of current task types for the item's item type.  the user is only presented with `Other (create new task type)`


when selecting the option for `Other (create new task type)` when creating a new task type, the request fails with a `✗ Error: Request failed` error.  check and see why that's failing.
